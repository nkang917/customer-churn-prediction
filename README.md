Banking Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

1. Developed algorithms to predict bank customer churn probability based on labeled data using Python.
2. Preprocessed dataset by data cleansing, categorical feature transformation and standardization, etc.
3. Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN and XGBoost.
4. Optimized hyper-parameters with k-fold cross-validation and applied regularization to overcome overfitting.
5. Evaluated model performance of classification (F1 score: 0.67) and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influenced the results.
